- 👋 Hi, I’m @Timothy-Pen
- 👀 I’m interested in many things and nothing specific. Would like to better understand the world we live in for the sake of my two kids.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic coding, HTML, CSS & yet to start on Javascript but I'll get there one day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not a thing, sorry not being rude I just don't have the knowledge or time to learn as quick as some. I might surprise myself one day & collaborate with someone but we'll see.
- 📫 How to reach me: tom377389@gmail.com
